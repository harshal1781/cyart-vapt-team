# Lab 4: Post-Exploitation Workflow

This lab simulated actions taken after gaining initial access to a system.

## Workflow

1.  **Privilege Escalation**: Used a Metasploit local exploit module to escalate from a user-level shell to a system-level (administrator) shell.
2.  **Evidence Collection**:
    * Captured network traffic during the exploit using Wireshark to log attacker communications.
    * Calculated the SHA256 hash of a downloaded system file to maintain a chain of custody.
3.  **Documentation**: All collected evidence was logged in a formal chain-of-custody table.
