# Lab 1: Advanced Exploitation Workflow

This lab focused on exploiting Metasploitable2, customizing a PoC, and reporting the findings.

## Workflow

1.  **Reconnaissance**: Scanned the target using `nmap` to identify open ports and services. A vulnerable UnrealIRCd service was found on port 6667.
2.  **Exploit Chain**:
    * **Stage 1 (Initial Access)**: Used Metasploit's `exploit/unix/irc/unreal_ircd_3281_backdoor` to gain a low-privilege shell.
    * **Stage 2 (Privilege Escalation)**: The next step would be to find a local privilege escalation vector to gain root access. This was noted as the subsequent risk.
3.  **PoC Customization**: Modified a Python PoC for CVE-2021-22205 (GitLab Unauthenticated RCE) to change the hardcoded payload, allowing for more flexible command execution against a target.
4.  **Reporting**: Documented the findings in a formal report and drafted an escalation email for the development team.
