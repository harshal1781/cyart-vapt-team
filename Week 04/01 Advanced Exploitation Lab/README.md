## 1. Advanced Exploitation Lab

* **Objective:** Chain vulnerabilities on a target VM, modify a PoC, and use ROP to bypass ASLR.
* **Workflow:**
    1.  Performed Nmap scan on target `192.168.18.140` (Mr. Robot VM).
    2.  Identified a vulnerable WordPress plugin using `wpscan`.
    3.  Used Metasploit (`exploit/multi/http/wordpress_plugin_rce`) to gain initial shell.
    4.  Studied an Exploit-DB Python PoC for a buffer overflow, modified it to adjust the EIP offset, and successfully gained a local shell.
    5.  Analyzed a local binary with Ghidra to find ROP gadgets to bypass ASLR/DEP.
* **Key Finding:** Successfully chained an XSS-to-RCE vulnerability, demonstrating a critical risk.
