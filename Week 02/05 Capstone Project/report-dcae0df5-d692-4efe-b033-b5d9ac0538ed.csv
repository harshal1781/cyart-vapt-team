  or have other, unspecified impacts.","The configuration of this services should be changed so that it
  does not accept the listed weak cipher suites anymore.

  Please see the references for more resources supporting you with this task.","All services providing an encrypted communication using weak
  SSL/TLS cipher suites.","These rules are applied for the evaluation of the cryptographic
  strength:

  - RC4 is considered to be weak (CVE-2013-2566, CVE-2015-2808)

  - Ciphers using 64 bit or less are considered to be vulnerable to brute force methods and
  therefore considered as weak (CVE-2015-4000)

  - 1024 bit RSA authentication is considered to be insecure and therefore as weak

  - Any cipher considered to be secure for only the next 10 years is considered as medium

  - Any other cipher is considered as strong","Checks previous collected cipher suites.

  NOTE: No severity for SMTP services with 'Opportunistic TLS' and weak cipher suites on port 25/tcp
  is reported. If too strong cipher suites are configured for this service the alternative would be
  to fall back to an even more insecure cleartext communication.
