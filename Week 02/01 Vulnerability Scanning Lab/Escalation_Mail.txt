URGENT: Critical RCE Vulnerability in Production Server


Body:
Hi Dev Team,
A critical vulnerability (CVE-2011-2523, CVSS 10.0) has been identified on the server at 192.168.18.138 during our recent scan. The installed VSFTPD service has a known backdoor allowing for unauthenticated remote code execution. An attacker can gain a root shell with a single command.

Proof-of-Concept: Connecting to port 6200 on the server provides immediate root access.

We must patch or disable this service immediately to prevent a full system compromise. The VAPT team is on standby to assist with validation after the patch is applied.


Thanks,
Harshal
